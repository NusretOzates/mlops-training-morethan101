## MLFlow Experiment Tracking

MLFlow is a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. 
It provides a central place to track experiments, compare results, and share models. 
It also provides a central place to store artifacts, such as datasets, models, and images. 

To follow this tutorial:

- Install the required packages
- Start the MLFlow server
- Run the notebook `duration-prediction-no-mlflow.ipynb`
- Run the notebook `duration-prediction.ipynb`
- Optionally run the notebook `model-registry.ipynb`

You will learn about why you should use experiment tracking and how to use MLFlow to track your experiments.
