
To install prefect, run the following command:

``pip install -U prefect``

To start prefect orion server, run the following command:

``prefect orion start``

To build a prefect flow deployment, run the following command:

``prefect deployment build ./log_flow.py:log_flow -n log-simple -q test``

This will create a file called ``log_flow-deployment.yaml`` in the current directory. This file can be used to deploy the flow to a Prefect backend.

To deploy the flow to a Prefect backend, run the following command:

``prefect deployment apply log_flow-deployment.yaml``

This will deploy the flow to the backend specified in the ``log_flow-deployment.yaml`` file.

To run the deployment, run the following command:

``prefect deployment run 'log-flow/log-simple'``

This will run the flow on the backend specified in the ``log_flow-deployment.yaml`` file.

Now, If you haven't already, you can run the following command to create a Prefect agent to run the flow:

``prefect agent start -q 'test'``
